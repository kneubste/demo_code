@mainpage Demo-Code

This code is for the <b>Electronics-Project Modules</b>
<b>ET.PM3: Cable-Monitor</b>
@n in the <b>second year of the electronics engineering curriculum</b>
at the School of Engineering of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.

The template code is written for the evaluation board
<b>32F429IDISCOVERY (Discovery kit with STM32F429ZI MCU)</b>.


Overall Information on the Project
===
For the module Electronics Project 3, a sensor board for a Cable-Monitor had to be developed, which allows to measure the electromagnetic and electrostatic field of a mains cable.
<br>Based on these measurements, the distance, the current through and the angle to the wire or cable can be determined.

The Cable-Monitor has the software functions to measure 4 inputs from 2 pads and 2 coils.
One can select wire, cable or angle measurement. For each is a different displaying method implemented.
<br>With the <b>blue</b> push button is a manual shut off possible.

@attention Time was very critical and thus the software is at an elementary stage and far from being perfect. Many things can be improved e.g.: more modularization, better functions and visualization.

@note  <b>All measurements are very sensor board and location depending. A correct function can therefore not be guaranteed.</b>
@note   Evalboard revision E (blue PCB) has an inverted y-axis
        in the touch controller compared to the display.
        Uncomment or comment the <b>\#define EVAL_REV_E</b> in main.h accordingly.

@bug No known bugs.
